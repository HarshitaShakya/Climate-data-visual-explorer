## 📌 About the Project

Climate change and weather forecasting are crucial in today’s world. This project combines **data science, visualization, and machine learning** to help users understand climate behavior in an easy, interactive way.

With this app, you can:
- 🌦 **Check Live Weather** → Get instant temperature, humidity, and conditions for any city  
- 📊 **Visualize Climate Trends** → Explore temperature and humidity changes over time  
- 🌧 **Rainfall Prediction** → Machine learning model predicts if it will rain tomorrow  
- 🔥 **Seasonal Heatmaps** → Discover monthly weather variations and extremes  
- 📈 **Forecasting** → Predict temperature & humidity for the next few hours  
- ⚠ **Anomaly Detection** → Identify unusual weather patterns or temperature spikes  

This makes it not only a **weather checking tool** but also a **climate analysis explorer** for research, learning, and awareness.
